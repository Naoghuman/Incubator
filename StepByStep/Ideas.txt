IDEAS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SwitchToGameMode
 - Prepare for GameMode
 - Show GameMode information
    - For example "Remember"
 - Show additional GameMode informations, components
    - Like Counter in GameMode.ATTENTION
    - Or (then) the LevelInformation
       - For example "Level 2", "2/0"
    - Dialog to define the UserName for HighScore (can be scipped).
 - Show GameMode main features, components
    - GameMode.PREVIEW   -> Later here is a GameBot to seen.
    - GameMode.ATTENTION -> Animated sequence from flashed elements.
    - GameMode.REMEMBER  -> User can remember the shown sequence.
    - GameMode.SUCCESS   -> Shows information that the User can successful done
                            the Level.
    - GameMode.ERROR     -> Shows information that the User have done an error.
    - GameMode.HIGHSCORE -> Shows a table with the Users HighScore.
    - GameMode.HELP      -> Shows the Help from the application.
 - Cleanup GameMode
    - Remove GameMode specific informations, components

GameEngine
 - Contains the functionalities for SwitchToGameMode and dependens stuff.

TestingPurpose
 - For testing purpose I will add tempor√§y components so that I can test the
   SwitchToGameMode.
 - TextField for input level
 - ComboBox with the GameModes, Button to switch to the GameMode.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LevelInfo-Component
 - Use Component from Hansolo. This with the simple color in circle and info in 
   the middle from the component. The idea is also that the glowing circle around
   the middle GameView is animated, like for every shown (successfull done) element
   a part from the circle glows more and in other color.

GameBot
 - A class which simulate different players from noob to profi.
 - The class can be used for TestingPurpose and for the Preview.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sound
 - Add unique SoundClip to the GameButtons. When a GameButton will flash then the
   SoundClip will be played.
