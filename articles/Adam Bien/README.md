Let me introduce myself. My name is `Peter Rogge` and I'm a software developer 
in Wolfsburg, Germany.

Since `2008` I work by [H+D International Group] which is an IT- and engineering 
service provider represented nationally and internationally in over 20 locations 
with the head-quarters in Wolfsburg, Germany.


<br />
In my free time I investigate between `2009` an `2012` some time in [NetBeans RCP] 
&#40;Rich Client Platform&#41; development.  
See  
* The `interview` [Help for Multilingual NetBeans Platform Applications] 
  &#40;09.2009&#41; with [Geertjan Wielenga] and me.
* The `book` [NetBeans Platform 6.9 Developer's Guide] &#40;08.2010&#41; which I 
  helped to translate from Germany to English.

<br />
Since `2011` I change my focus to [JavaFX] &#40;[JavaFX 2.0] - [JavaFX 8]&#41;. 
Although in `2015` I saw a video from [Adam Bien] where he mention he would love 
to write a [NetBeans RCP] plugin for his library [afterburner.fx] when he had 
more time.  
So I decided to do this:
* See the [GitHub] project [NetBeansIDE-AfterburnerFX-Plugin] &#40;since 09.2015&#41; 
  which is really helpful to speed up the development from [JavaFX] applications 
  in combination with the library [afterburner.fx].
* The `interview` [Afterburner.fx NetBeans Plugin Release] &#40;11.2015&#41; 
  with [Adam Bien] and me.
* Have a look in the `video` [DI, IoC and MVP With Java FX -- afterburner.fx Deep Dive] 
  where [Adam Bien] introduce my plugin &#40;at 48:00&#41;.
